# Skin Cancer Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting skin cancer using deep learning techniques, specifically using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project leverages a skin disease image dataset to classify skin cancer images. The model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is from Kaggle and can be accessed using the following link:
